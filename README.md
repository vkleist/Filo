Matlab codes for parameter inference and simulation of the data-driven Markov model of filopodial dynamics and synapse formation in Drosophila R7 photoreceptors, used in the Dev Cell paper (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2019.06.014).

A detailed description of what the different routines are actually doing can be found in Description.docx
